    AFTERLIFE IS FULL, OLD FRIENDS BREAK OUT
    
    

critters:
@   - humans and civilized demi-humans (humans, elves, dwarves, etc)
&   - angels and demons (angels, demons, imps, demon-lords)

The rest would be DYNAMIC like Dwarf Fortress' MEGABEASTS.

HD hit dice, like levels, gives bonuses to all others
HP cur/max obvious
SP cur/max for special moves
ATK for attack value to-hit
DEF for defense value penalizes enemy to-hit
DMG for damage rating
ARM for armor rating

for now, let us disregard the difference between ranged and melee attack ratings
